### Interacting with Contracts in Ethersjs

Now we have deployed the contract at https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Ether.js5.git <br>

We can alos learn to interact with our contract through code as well <br>

Here we use the above line of code to retrieve current favorite  number <br>

the contract object thet we have is what return from our contractfactory  <br>
as long as we awited it <br>

the contract object can come with all the functionality in our ABI <br>

that is why we have to pass ABI to our contract factory <br>
